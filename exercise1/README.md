This folder is used to store code and results of a hybrid parallel version of the well-known Conway's Game of Life, implemented using both MPI and OpenMP.
The game has been executed on EPYC and THIN nodes of the Orfeo cluster. In particular, three different scalability studies have been performed:

- openMP scalability
- strongMPI scalability
- weakMPI scalability
