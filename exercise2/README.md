This folder contains data used for comparing three distinct mathematical libraries: **BLIS**, **OpenBLAS**, and **MKL**. Measurements were conducted on both EPYC and THIN nodes of the *Orfeo* cluster at AreaSciencePark, with each set of measurements repeated five times.

## Folder Structure

- The **EPYC** and **THIN** folders share a similar structure.
- Each folder contains two subfolders (**float** and **double**) designed for storing data pertaining to single and double-precision operations.

## File Naming Convention

The naming convention for the .csv files follows this pattern:

`$varying_parameter-$library_name-$partition_name-$thread_policy-$precision.csv`

- `$varying_parameter`: The parameter that varies in the data, either **size** or **core**.
- `$library_name`: The name of the mathematical library (**blis**, **oblas**, or **mkl**).
- `$partition_name`: The name of the data partition (**e** for EPYC nodes and **t** for THIN nodes).
- `$thread_policy`: The thread affinity policy (**c** for close or **s** for spread).
- `$precision`: The precision of the operations (**d** for double or **f** for float).


## Graphs

Graphs were generated by plotting the mean values from the five iterations, along with their corresponding standard deviations.
